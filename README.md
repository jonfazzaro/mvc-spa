As requested, a basic proof-of-concept for [Turn your ASP.NET MVC app into a Single Page Application with one classy Sammy.js route](http://blog.apterainc.com/bid/313071/turn-your-asp-net-mvc-app-into-a-single-page-application-with-one-classy-sammy-js-route).

The **About** and **Contact** links in the header navigation have been updated to reflect the fact that these views get handled by the Sammy route in question, and are loaded into the page via an out-of-band request. I have left it as an exercise for you, dear reader, to update the other links in the app in a similar fashion.
